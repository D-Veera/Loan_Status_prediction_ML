# Loan_Status_prediction_ML

### Project Objective
    The objective of this project is to develop a predictive model to determine the likelihood of loan approval for applicants based on their personal, financial, and demographic information. This model could be used by financial institutions to streamline loan approval processes by automating initial assessments, helping prioritize applications, and minimizing risk.

### Dataset Overview
    The dataset, presumably named Loan_prediction.csv, consists of a series of rows representing loan applications, with each column corresponding to features such as applicant income, education, marital status, and loan-related information
**1.Rows and Columns:** The dataset contains a certain number of rows and columns, each representing various features.
**2.Features:**
    - Basic Applicant Information: Gender, Married, Education, Dependents, Self_Employed.
    - Financial Details: ApplicantIncome, CoapplicantIncome, LoanAmount, Loan_Amount_Term.
    - Loan-Related Data: Credit_History, Property_Area, and Loan_Status (target variable).

**Steps and Methodology**
#### 1. Data Loading and Exploration:
    - The dataset is loaded using pandas.
    - Initial exploration includes viewing the shape, basic statistical details, and first few rows to understand the dataâ€™s structure.
#### 2. Data Preprocessing:
    - **Handling Missing Values:**Identifies and calculates the percentage of missing values, with certain columns potentially dropped or imputed based on the context.
