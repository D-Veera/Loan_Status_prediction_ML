# Loan_Status_prediction_ML

### Project Objective
    The objective of this project is to develop a predictive model to determine the likelihood of loan approval for applicants based on their personal, financial, and demographic information. This model could be used by financial institutions to streamline loan approval processes by automating initial assessments, helping prioritize applications, and minimizing risk.
